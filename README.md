# Research-Trading-Value-of-Chinese-GVIX

- This paper uses a new method for constructing a generalized
volatility index (GVIX) for the Chinese market, which is not based
on the assumption of geometric Brownian motion underlying the
traditional VIX index. The article examines the properties of GVIX
in the Chinese market with reference to the existing literature.
Finally, the study compares GVIX with other volatility indices by
evaluating the performance of option trading strategies using each
index as the implied volatility input. The results demonstrate that
GVIX-based strategies achieve the highest annualized returns of
47.62% and a competitive Sharpe ratio of 1.94, suggesting that
GVIX offers effective volatility information for option pricing
